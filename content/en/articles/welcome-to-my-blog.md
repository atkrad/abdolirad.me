Hello and welcome! I’m Mohammad Abdolirad, and I’m excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and the things that inspire me through this blog. I’m a software and platform engineer with a background in coding, automation, and system architecture. Since starting my career in 2013, I've had the opportunity to work with a wide range of technologies, from cloud platforms to container orchestration systems like Kubernetes. When I’m not diving into code or building infrastructure, you can often find me experimenting in the kitchen or exploring new ideas in technology.

### Why I Started This Blog

I’ve always enjoyed sharing knowledge, whether it's through my work, personal projects, or casual conversations. Starting this blog is my way of connecting with others in the tech community and beyond, documenting my journey, and sharing the lessons I've learned along the way. I hope this platform can serve as a place for me to share insights, problem-solving strategies, and personal experiences that others might find useful or inspiring.

### What to Expect

This blog will cover a variety of topics, all revolving around my interests and experiences. Some of the things I’ll be writing about include:

- **Software Development:** Tips, tricks, and lessons learned from my experience coding in languages like Go and PHP.
- **Platform Engineering & Automation:** Insights into my work with tools like Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, and NixOS.
- **Personal Growth and Productivity:** Strategies that have helped me stay focused, productive, and balanced.

In addition to technical posts, I’ll share reflections on my journey in software engineering, the challenges I’ve faced, and the solutions I’ve found.

### A Bit About Me

I’ve always had a passion for technology, starting from my curiosity about computers as a kid to becoming a software engineer. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects, building scalable and reliable platforms that power modern applications. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and exploring new technologies, always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the tech world.

### Why I’m Writing This Blog

Through this blog, I aim to give back to the tech community and offer insights that may help others in their professional and personal journeys. Whether you're a developer, an engineer, or someone passionate about technology, I hope you’ll find something valuable here.

I’m looking forward to sharing more in the coming weeks and connecting with like-minded individuals. If you ever want to discuss any of the topics I write about or have suggestions for future posts, don’t hesitate to reach out!

Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy following along as I share my thoughts, experiences, and lessons learned.

Stay tuned for more!
